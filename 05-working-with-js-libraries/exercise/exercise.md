# Exercise: Working with JS Libraries

1. Install the types for `react-router-dom`, so the app starts

2. Install [`filled-array`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/filled-array) and create your own type definition file for it.

3. Remember to update `tsconfig.json` with the correct base url.

4. Use `filled-array` to create an array with a count of three, filled with your name to confirm you're typings work as expect. Render the array as an unordered list in the `About` component.
