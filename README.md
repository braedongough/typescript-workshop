# Learn Typescript Using React - Workshop ‚öõÔ∏è

This workshop has been designed to empower you with the foundations of Typescript by building on your knowledge of React. I want you to feel comfortable starting your next React project using TS.

Consider this repo a tool you can reference for the future as you continue to build and expand your knowledge of TS.

## Workshop prerequisites

-   A strong understanding of React and hooks

## Preparing for the workshop

1. Make sure `yarn` is install globally on your computer

2. Make sure you're running a compatible version of Node: `^8.10.0 || ^10.13.0 || >=11.10.1`. Check out [Node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

3. Read through the workshop structure and familiars yourself with the content

4. Clone this repo onto your machine

5. `cd app` and run `yarn` to install node_modules

## Workshop structure ‚õ©

Each section of the workshop is numbered and named after the subject, e.g. 01-ts-config-and-using-types. Each section will include a lesson and exercise. We will work through the exercise together to find the solution.

`app/` contains a create-react-app that we will be converting from JS to TS through the course of this workshop. This will be done during each exercise throughout each section.

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Lesson + Q&A
2. Exercise
    - ~10 to 30 minutes per exercise
    - I recommend reading through all of the questions in an exercise before coding
    - Go slow and read the errors. Typescript will usually guide you in the right direction.
3. Solution

## Help Make This Workshop Better üèÜ

After the workshop, I would love if you could take 5 minutes to answer a few questions so I can learn how to improve this workshop in the future:

[Typescript Workshop Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/kNuP8dwPfW2R5BKF6)

## TODOs for refactor

-   add branch protections
-   create protected branch for TS version of app. Main branch will have the JS version
-   Create new feedback form for every workshop

## Lesson ideas

### 03

-   Introduce mudkipme/pokeapi-v2-typescript lib
-   Response from get single pokemon api is huge, so use library instead
-   still make mention of definitely/typed

## 04

-   talk about generic that useState takes
-   Replace interfaces created into 02 with new library ones since they take generic
