# Learn Typescript through React - Workshop

This workshop has been designed to empower you with the foundations of Typescript by building on your knowledge of React. I want you to feel comfortable starting your next React project using TS.

Consider this repo a tool you can reference for the future as you continue to build and expand your knowledge of TS.

## Workshop prerequisites

- A strong understanding of React and hooks

## Preparing for the workshop

1. Make sure `yarn` is install globally on your computer

2. Read through the workshop structure and familiars yourself with the content

3. Clone this repo onto your machine

4. Run `./install-all` from the root of the project to install the `node_modules` in advance for each lesson: [Link to video guide](https://www.loom.com/share/26a2cdc323c748bc94eddfa1e823876d)

## Workshop structure ⛩

Each section will include a lesson, exercise, and solution.

`lesson.md` will contain the plan and notes for each section.

`lesson/` will act as out scratch pad during the lesson.

Within `exercise/` you'll find an `exercise.md` which outlines what you'll need to do.

`solution/` contains my solution to the questions in `exercise.md`

## How it works

Process for every lesson:

1. Lesson & Q&A
   - Example code from lesson will be pushed to repo so you can reference it during the exercises
2. Exercise
   - ~ 20 - 30 minutes per exercise
   - I recommend reading through all of the questions in an exercise before coding
   - Go slow and read the errors. Typescript will usually guide you in the right direction.
3. Solution
