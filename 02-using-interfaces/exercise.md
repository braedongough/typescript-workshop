# Exercises Lesson 2

1. Convert `src/components/pokemon-card.jsx` to `src/components/pokemon-card.tsx`

2. Create a `Props` interface for the `PokemonCard` component to resolve the type errors.

3. Convert `src/components/stats.jsx` to `src/components/stats.tsx`

4. Create a `Props` interface for the `Stats` component to resolve the type errors.

_hint: You'll need to create a Pokemon interface based on the properties you see being used in the component. We'll create a complete one later on._

Extra: Create shared interfaces that can be used with the `utils` functions and within our `Pokemon` interface created for the `Stats` component.
